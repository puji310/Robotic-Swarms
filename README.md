# 🤖 Robotic Swarms

**Robotic swarms for autonomous search operations**

## 🐝 Swarm Robotics Simulation with Dynamic Obstacles and Target Discovery

This project simulates a team of autonomous robots navigating a 2D environment to discover and report targets while avoiding dynamic obstacles and maintaining formation. It features:

- Leadership switching  
- Failure handling  
- Obstacle avoidance  
- Formation control  
- Target discovery visualization  

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Multi-robot coordination (formation keeping with a leader-follower model)
- 🎯 Target search and discovery
- 📡 Communication and information sharing
- ⚠️ Dynamic obstacle avoidance
- 🔁 Leadership scoring and switching
- 🧭 Exploration behavior
- 💥 Random failure simulation
- 📊 Visualization of robot trajectories and position vs. time plots
